    "### What is a Python Package\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a package is a bundle of pre-built functionality that adds to the functionality available in base Python. Base Python can do many things such as perform math and other operations. However, Python packages can significantly extend this functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of a Python package as a toolbox filled with tools. The tools in the toolbox can be used to do things that you would have to otherwise hand code in base Python. These tasks are things that many people might want to do in Python, thus warranting the creation of a package. After all, it doesn’t make sense for everyone to hand code everything!\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the matplotlib package allows you to create plots of data. Since most of us create plots routinely, having a Python package to create plots makes programming more efficient for everyone who needs to create plots."
